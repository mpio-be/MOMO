# Multifunctional Mainboard to Observe and Manipulate Organisms MOMO
# alias MAPRDL

Platform for Animal Observation and Manipulation 

An efficient system to monitor and control animal behaviour in wildlife
as well as in laboratory settings

-	Being compatible with different RFID systems and triggers
-	Low power consumption and specific data collection leading to long lasting collection periods
-	Being applicable world-wide due to its compatibility with different types of radio clock receivers 
-	Increasing the observation quality via decreasing the disturbance to the animals
-   Supports broad range of technical applications like e.g. traps, gates, feeders, lights, cameras
-	Data-transfer to external devices, such as personal computers
