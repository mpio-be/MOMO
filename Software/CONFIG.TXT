# Configuration Variables in config.txt:

# ON_TIME, OFF_TIME [hour:min]
#   These variables determine the on and off time of the feeder.  When it
#   is in the off state, the feeder is closed and light barriers are ignored.

# LB_FILTER_DURATION [s]
#   Light barrier (LB) filter duration in seconds.  The LB may change its
#   state several times during a bird is picking food.  To prevent the
#   underlying logic from assuming each time "a new bird", this filter has
#   been implemented.  The duration starts whenever the LB turns to inactive
#   state, i.e. no object is detected any more.  When the LB returns active
#   before this time is over, this event will be ignored.  Timing diagram:
#                         ____        __

# RFID_PWR_OFF_TIMEOUT [s]
#   Duration in seconds after which the RFID reader is powered-off.  It is
#   measured from the time when the light barrier filter gets inactive.

# RFID_DETECT_TIMEOUT [s]
#   Duration in seconds measured from the trigger, i.e. when the light barrier
#   filter output gets active or a transponder has been read already.
#   Within this period, the system tries to identify the bird by its
#   transponder ID.  If no transponder is detected, the bird is treated
#   as UNKNOWN and the feeder usually will be closed.

# KEEP_OPEN [s]
#   Default duration in seconds how long the shutter keeps open.  Letter "A"
#   means always - use this if the feeder should be permanently left open.

# KEEP_CLOSED [s]
#   Default duration in seconds how long the shutter keeps closed.  Letter "A"
#   means always - use this if the feeder should be permanently kept closed.

# CAM1_DURATION [s]
#   Duration in seconds, CAM1 is still powered after light barrier filter
#   output has been gone inactive.  Be aware, the camera itself may be
#   configured to have an additional time before powering off.

# ID
#   Transponder ID and optional parameters.
#
#       ID = 0123456789012345:{KEEP_OPEN}:{KEEP_CLOSED}:{CAM1_DURATION}
#
#   Fields may be left empty to use default values, for example
#   ID = 9E1CE7D001AF0001:::120 specifies 120s (2min) for camera 1 duration,
#   but uses the default settings for KEEP_OPEN and KEEP_CLOSED.
#   There are two special IDs: "ANY" means there was a transponder detected,
#   but its ID is not listed in this file.  "UNKNOWN" means that NO transponder
#   could be detected within RFID_DETECT_TIMEOUT.
